# Security Policy

**Effective Date:** 04/03/2025 (March 4th, 2025)

At **KanaDojo**, we take security seriously and strive to protect our website and users from potential threats. Although our website does not collect personal user data directly, we implement security measures to safeguard our platform.

---

## 1. Scope

This Security Policy applies to the **KanaDojo** website (kanadojo.com), including its infrastructure, content, and third-party services used (such as Google Analytics).

---

## 2. Website Security Practices

To ensure the security of our website, we:

- Use **HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption)** to protect data transmitted between the website and users.
- Regularly update our **software, dependencies, and third-party services** to mitigate security vulnerabilities.
- Monitor for unauthorized access, potential threats, and security issues.
- Restrict administrative access to trusted personnel only.

## 3. Data Security & Privacy

We do not collect personal data directly. However, we use **Google Analytics**, which gathers anonymous usage information (e.g., page visits, browser type, and geographic location).

To enhance data security:

- We **do not store sensitive or personally identifiable information**.
- Google Analytics data is handled under [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
- We allow users to **opt out of Google Analytics tracking** using browser settings or the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
